# AutomaticRailwayGate
As Human safety is the major goal for Railways, so that, this project aims to achieve Automatic Control at the level crossings. 
When arrival and departure of train takes place, by replacing the manual gate control the Railway gate will be  closed automatically. 
The detection of arrival and departure of the train is done by using two IR sensors.
The gate will be opened and closed by using servomotors which are controlled by Ardiuno Uno.
Buzzers/Red LEDs are used to indicate the closing of gate for people who try to cross the gate.
This system helps to avoid the increasing percentage of the accidents at level crossings in India. The hardware  supported by Arduino C Programming. 
The proposed system is more reliable and cost effective.
